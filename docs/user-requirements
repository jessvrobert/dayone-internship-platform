# Methodology
The user requirements were collected by means of a structured online questionnaire dispatched to 30 university 
students (various faculties and academic levels). The objective was to identify obstacles in finding internships, 
preparing to find internships, and decent work opportunities.
This approach enabled us to gather not only the quantitative indicators (e.g. percentages and strength of 
preferences) but also the qualitative information (e.g. perceived friction and unmet needs). I applied the 
principles of participatory design so that the user input directly influences the system requirements, rather 
than assuming their presence based on the implied data.

Data collection focused on:
- Internship preparation challenges
- Experiences with existing placement platforms
- Preferred communication and tracking mechanisms
- Feature expectations for a supportive intenrship platforms

The methodology follows established Human Computer Interaction (HCI) practices for early-stage requirements 
elicitation and supports the broader goal of inclusive and equitable access to early career opportunities.
