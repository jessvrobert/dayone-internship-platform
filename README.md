# dayone-internship-platform
# A day-one–ready internship placement app for university students.

# Why I develop this app?
  As a university student myself who had faced the tough times searching for an internship
  last minute which was two months before supposed employement that was set by my uni, while 
  panickingly applying for internships I only repeat one thought in my mind; 
  "Why there's no app for internship placement?" 
  "Why do students who have no experience in searching for a job are now being told 
  to find a job on our own with no guidance?"
  (does not apply to uni that teaches their student how to find one though)
  Therefore, this is where I came from.

# Why want to build one when they're already existed?
  Yes there are existing one's in which job searching applications that is applicable for students too,
  but as a student who majors in system engineering it felt like a responsibility help my fellow students 
  to create a convinient and efficent way for their internship placements process easier than mine!

# What's the Solution?
This is what I am proposing:
--> Contralized internship listings
--> Resume/CV builder
--> In-app messaging for better communication
--> Community for guidance

# Target User
1. University students
2. Internship-seeking
